## About

Welcome to the JavaScript Browser Game Tamagotchi Lab, a nostalgic journey to the late '90s and early 2000s, when virtual pet simulators were all the rage!

In this lab, you will recreate a simplified version of this classic game, combining your knowledge of HTML, CSS, and DOM manipulation. You'll be faced with managing three critical statistics for your creature ‚Äì boredom, hunger, and sleepiness ‚Äì keeping them within a safe range to maintain a happy and healthy virtual pet.

While fun and engaging, this lab demonstrates the real-world application of these foundational web development skills, solidifying your understanding and preparing you for more complex projects.
